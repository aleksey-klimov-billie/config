# Spell check

Correct the grammar and make the text sound more natural. Use clear technical English and a friendly, welcoming tone. Provide just one improved version.

After generating the text, you MUST copy the result to the system clipboard using the `execute_command` tool with `pbcopy`.
Example command: `echo "improved text" | pbcopy`
